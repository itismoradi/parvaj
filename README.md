# Parvaj

![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/machitgarha/parvaj?color=purple&label=Version&style=flat-square)

Easy and semi-intelligent VHDL simulation tool, integrating GHDL and GTKWave.

## Features

-   **Easy:**

    -   ðŸ’¡ Zero-configuration by default. Go ahead and simulate your design!

    -   â˜• Easy to use. You don't need to remember or look for dependencies everytime, Parvaj does this for you. You wouldn't even need to know most of the GHDL command-line options.

    <!-- TODO: Add this when AppImage is provided:
    -   â˜” Simple installation process, by providing Phar files.
    -->

-   **Fast:**

    -   â›½ Speed up your development. Don't get your hands dirty by invoking GHDL and GTKWave manually, use the simple `simulate` command instead to do all the steps for you.

    -   âš¡ The tool itself is designed to have good performance. It uses a proper cache mechanism for this. Although it uses regex patterns for major tasks, thanks to fast PHP regex engine, you wouldn't notice slowdowns.

-   **Semi-intelligent:**

    -   ðŸ”¥ Automatic detection of dependencies. Forget about what depends on what.

    -   ðŸ§  After finding where a unit (e.g. entity) leaves, it remembers it. Don't worry, it is smart enough to check if it was moved around or has been renamed. Just use it!

## Let's Install!

There are two methods to install Parvaj: Use a Phar file, or include it as Git submodule. We only cover the main method here. For other methods, please refer to [installation methods](docs/en/installation.md).

### Use a Phar File

#### Requirements

-   PHP 8.0+
-   GHDL
-   GTKWave

Having a Linux distribution, installing these should be easy. For instance, on Fedora 35, you could simply do:

```bash
sudo dnf install php ghdl gtkwave
```

#### Getting It

1.  Download [Parvaj Phar file](https://github.com/machitgarha/parvaj/releases/download/latest/parvaj.phar).

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/machitgarha/parvaj/releases/download/latest/parvaj.phar
    ```

1.  Make it executable.

    ```bash
    chmod +x parvaj.phar
    ```

1.  Put it somewhere in your `$PATH`.

    ```bash
    # Supposing ~/.local/bin is in your $PATH
    mv parvaj.phar ~/.local/bin
    ```

1.  Done! Make sure the installation was successful:

    ```bash
    parvaj
    ```

Throughout this document, it is supposed you installed Parvaj using this method.

## How to Use?

The primary Parvaj command is `simulate`. It simulates a test-bench for you, given its name. Yes, it is really that simple!

For example, to simulate a test-bench named `test_multiplexer_2_to_1`, run:

```bash
parvaj simulate test_multiplexer_2_to_1
```

Woah! Got the magic?

Note that, for the `simulate` command to work correctly, you must be in the project root, not one of its sub-directories. It might be annoying for some people, but not implemented yet ([#2](https://github.com/machitgarha/parvaj/issues/2)).

### Other Options and the Use of Helps

You may also want to use specific GHDL options, or some options provided by Parvaj. In this case, you could use the `help` command to see a full list of options with their explanations:

```bash
parvaj help simulate
# Or
parvaj simulate --help
```

For example, with `--workdir` option, you can change the working directory (which is `build/` by default):

```bash
parvaj simulate test_multiplexer_2_to_1 --workdir=obj/
```
## Platform Support

Everything should work fine on Linux-based platforms, and generally Unix-like ones (e.g. OS X). It should run on Windows as well, but not properly tested.

## Contributions? Of Course!

Feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. You can also consider the to-do list below.

But hey, contribution can be simpler than that: Recommend Parvaj to your friends, if you liked it!

### Donations

If you live in Iran, you can make donations [here](https://coffeebede.ir/buycoffee/machitgarha). Otherwise, open an issue telling why you cannot donate from the outside. :)

### To-Do

-   Distribute as AppImage. No need to install PHP, or even with a seperated statically-bundled version, no need to install GHDL or GTKWave, just download and run it.
